The SageMaker Pipelines service supports a SageMaker Pipeline domain specific language (DSL), which is a declarative JSON specification. This DSL defines a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of pipeline parameters and SageMaker job steps. The SageMaker Python Software Developer Kit (SDK) streamlines the generation of the pipeline DSL using constructs that engineers and scientists are already familiar with.
